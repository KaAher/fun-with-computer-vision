## Computer Vision Image Filter App

A simple yet powerful project that applies various **computer vision filters** to images using Python. This project demonstrates how different image processing techniques can be used to enhance or transform images.

### Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy
* **Application Type:** Computer Vision / Image Processing
* **Application link:** https://fun-with-computer-vision-jkbuxvqpbre8pqt9pbxp9f.streamlit.app/

### Features

* Upload and process images
* Apply multiple filters such as:

  * Grayscale
  * Blur
  * Edge Detection (Canny)
  * Thresholding
  * Sepia and more
* Save the filtered image output
* Easy-to-use interface for experimentation

###  Use Cases

* Learning basic computer vision operations
* Understanding how filters impact image data
* Prototype for further development in CV projects
